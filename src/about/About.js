            Born and raised in the Bay Area, SJSU graduate, and self-taught
            programmer. Strong interest in full-stack development focusing on
            well designed, clean, responsive, and scalable code. A quick
            learner, self starter, innovative, and creative. I am a lover of
            mountains, cats, and movies. I enjoy living a well-balanced
            lifestyle, raising cultural awareness, and traveling. Some of my
            hobbies include hiking, running, movies, taking pictures of food or
            my cat sleeping, hot yoga, and weight training at the gym.
